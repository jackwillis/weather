# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (unreleased)
First version.
- `weather`: current conditions over TLS (built-in BearSSL, no proxy) from Open-Meteo; retries with backoff,
  data-source fallback, sysexits exit codes, settings file (`~/.weatherrc`), `-S` to save the location,
  clean cancel on SIGINT/SIGTERM.
- `xweather`: CDE-look X11 window with menus, Location dialog, weather pictures, auto-refresh every 15 minutes,
  stale-data display after failures.
- Portable core (`src/core`, `src/app`) with an OS seam; NetBSD/macppc is the first target.
- Tests: compile-time `static_assert`s, 203 unit checks, parser mutation tests, 65 CLI feature tests, a 21-step GUI
  scenario (also on real hardware), UBSan build, vendored and pinned BearSSL, reproducible trust anchors.
